                    <p>
                        Greetings and welcome to my portfolio site detailing my journey in game programming, 
                        I am a recent Computer Science graduate but have been programming for over 6 years now.
                        I am experienced in coding languages like C#, C++, HTML and GLSL and have a professional 
                        knowledge in using software such as, Unity, Unreal Engine 5 and Visual Studio.
                        <br><br>
                        I have had a strong passion for games since I got my very first exposure to it from my Gameboy
                        when I was 4 years old, my first game was Sonic Advance although nowadays I play ones such as
                        Baldurs Gate 3 and Monster Hunter Rise. 
                    </p>

                        Description - This is a game based around nordic mythology, the finished product will be a 
                        three way mixture between a roguelike, base building and survival horror game. I am co-developing 
                        this project witn another game programmer called Adam Crofts. <br> My contributions to this project 
                        will be developing the various maps the player will explore using procedural generation, some areas 
                        that I have designed included a hub area, dungeons, underwater cities and enemy camps. Also I am coding 
                        the interactive features of the map such as NPC's, enemy traps and base creation.</p>

                            Description - This game is been created for a Game Jam, its gameplay derives inspiration from the 
                            Dead Ops Arcade mode found in Call of Duty games where the player fights hordes of zombies in a top-down 
                            perspective. This project is being co-developed with another game programmer called Adam Crofts. <br> My
                            contributions to this project is designing the level the player will be placed in, currently the idea is to
                            make a city environment for the Game Jam but after to extend the game I plan to add more varied levels. Alongside
                            the level design I am also working on the artificial intelligence for the zombie horde.

                        <p> Role - Solo Developer<br>
                            This project showcases my proficiency in object-oriented design, incorporating advanced programming principles such as Run-time Polymorphism and Inheritance for a robust and scalable foundation.
                            The implementation features a seamless multiplayer experience, allowing players to engage with up to three friends or AI-driven opponents. The emphasis on a meticulously crafted object-oriented design ensures not only a sophisticated gaming experience but also facilitates future expansion and maintenance.
                            <br>
                            A key highlight of this project is the integration of an intelligent autosave function. This functionality, triggered at the conclusion of each round, ensures the preservation of game progress. This design choice offers users the convenience of seamlessly resuming their games at their leisure, reinforcing a user-centric approach to application development.
                            <br>
                            Presented through a console window, the user interface is intentionally text-centric, emphasizing a clean and professional aesthetic. This deliberate design decision enhances accessibility, allowing players to focus on the strategic intricacies of the game.</p>

                        <p> Role - Solo Developer<br>
                            Description - This project showcases my expertise in the creation and rendering of a 3D scene, achieved without reliance on an existing game engine. Throughout the development of this scene, I meticulously coded essential elements, showcasing a comprehensive skill set that includes draw calls, vertex buffer and array objects, shaders, lighting, input controls, and animation.
                        The scene is set in a room hosting 3 pedestals with different objects on them including an armadillo, each object had different properties, making them unique. For example the armadillo 
                        could have its size scaled by the player via keybinds and another had a moon revolving around it. This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in C# but also provided a hands-on experience with GLSL, a coding language integral to shader development. 
                        The incorporation of GLSL allowed me to enhance the visual aesthetics of the scene, adding depth and realism through finely tuned shaders. </p>

                        <p> Role - Solo Developer<br>
                            Description - This project showcases my expertise in crafting and rendering immersive 3D scenes using GLSL and shaders within the dedicated shader programming software, RenderMonkey. Drawing inspiration from the popular mobile game "Mexico Rex," I envisioned and constructed a scene set within a dynamic cave environment.

                            RenderMonkey served as the instrumental platform for the realization of this project, providing a robust framework for shader development. Leveraging its capabilities, I employed advanced graphic effects to breathe life into the scene.
                            
                            Through the creation of this intricate environment, I deepened my understanding of GLSL, gaining valuable insights into the intricacies of the language. This project not only demonstrates my technical proficiency but also showcases my ability to translate creative inspiration into a visually compelling and technically sound 3D rendering. </p>

                        <p> Role - Solo Developer<br>
                            Description - The aim of this project was to develop a path finding artifical intelligence that finds the shortest route to the player, in this project I developed two different types of algorithms to make this possible, these are A* and LRTA*. The A* algorithm is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, it needs to take in at least 3 parameters
                            to work, these being the player, the bot and the map itself, with these it can calculate the optimal route to the player from the bot keeping in mind any walls that can stop it. The LTRA* alogrithm is similar to the A* alogirthm, the main difference is that it allows the player to see the bot searching for the optimal route in real time. Overall, this
                            project was very interesting and made me passionate about the possibilities with artificial intelligence.</p>

                            Description - In this project I designed a basic game engine and also a game using this engine. In the game engine I had to code things such as general collision detection with a Engine Collision Manager which would be used by the game for physical collisions and trigger collisions, I also implemented an Entity Manager, Resource Manager and Scene Manager. 
                            The final game was sort of like a classic DOOM style game.</p>

                            Description - In this project I got to experience many different areas of game development, firstly I was the project lead, this was because the game we were making came from my game proposal. As the project lead I had to organise and arrange the team to be as efficient as we could be, having only a 2 month schedule to create the game meant I had to make sure
                            that the project wasn't too overly ambitious and that my team wasnt getting overwhelmed by it. I was also the lead game programmer where I coded the bulk of the project and its mechanics, this project was created with the help of Unity Engine which tools were very useful. Also I did the audio design of the game, for the sound effects I sourced them from around the internet
                            and the game music I created myself using Soundtrap.</p>

                            Description - This project was done as my final year project for university, it was set in a forested environment where the player must go to four different trials and complete them. After doing this they will recieve an item from each which when combined together will be able to tame the dragon of the mountain to help in an ongoing war. This game was created to play on virtual reality
                            headsets, in particular the Oculus brand, it was very interesting as it was my first time making a game in VR, I also tried to make all of the assets myself but felt like it would be better to leave the complex assets like the animals to a third party. Ultimately this was an incredible experience where I learned a lot of new knowledge in game development and have now gained the experience
                            of creating virtual reality games which I hope to explore again soon once I have a new VR headset to test on.</p>
